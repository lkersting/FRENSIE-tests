# Verification and Validation for FRENSIE

## Neutron Verification Tests

### Bare Hydrogen Sphere
All of these tests consist of a sphere of H1 with a radius of 1.0 cm and an
atom density of 1.0 atom/(b-cm) surrounded by a vacuum. The temperature of the
H1 is changed for each test to verify the free-gas thermal model
implementation. For each test both the current per lethargy and the flux
spectrum is calculated.

1. T = 293.6 K

2. T = 600 K

3. T = 900 K

4. T = 1200 K

5. T = 2500 K
